                <h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>
                    Over and over
                    <br>The pheromones, the overwhelming harmony
                    <br>Consuming the colony
                    <br>The Circle rules your life
                </p>

                <h3>Verse</h3>
                <p>
                    Chop, chop, don't want to be late
                    <br>Lift up and carry your weight
                    <br>You've got no choice but to dance
                    <br>In a spiral of ants
                    <br>True bugs might laugh in your face
                    <br>Don't fret, you're leading the race
                    <br>Don't let the bastards step on your hands
                    <br>In a spiral of ants
                </p>

                <h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
                <p>
                    You can't remember where you came from <em>(In a spiral of ants)</em>
                    <br>You can't remember where you're going <em>(In a spiral of ants)</em>
                    <br>You can't remember knowing
                    <br>You are one ant
                </p>

                <h3>Chorus</h3>
                <p>
                    Over, it's over
                    <br>The pheromones, the self-avoiding odyssey
                    <br>Consuming the colony
                    <br>The Circle rules your life
                </p>

                <h3>Verse</h3>
                <p>
                    Now, now, don't run out of breath
                    <br>Don't feel surrounded by death, no
                    <br>Take the wheel, this could be your chance
                    <br>In a spiral of ants
                    <br>False bugs, you'll soon be alone
                    <br>See how they drop like a stone
                    <br>You're free now forever to dance
                    <br>In a spiral of ants
                </p>
                
                <h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
                <p>
                    Now you remember where you came from <em>(From a spiral of ants)</em>
                    <br>Now you remember where you're going <em>(To a spiral of ants)</em>
                    <br>You've got to keep it flowing
                    <br>You are one ant <em>(Over, over, over)</em>
                </p>

                <h3>Chorus</h3>
                <p>
                    Over and over
                    <br>The pheromones, the overwhelming harmony
                    <br>Consuming the colony
                    <br>Creating its own gravity
                    <br>Before we knew it we became a hurricane
                    <br>And the bugs who laughed got blown away
                    <br>As we proclaimed:
                    <br>The Circle rules your life
                </p>
