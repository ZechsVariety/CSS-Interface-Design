				<h1>Jermiderata</h1>

			<main>
				<p>Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in Jerma. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all Jermas. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to the Jermas, even the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.</p>
				<p>Avoid loud and aggressive Jermas, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with Jerma, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser Jermas than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.</p>
				<p>Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for Jerma is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many Jermas strive for high ideals; and everywhere Jerma is full of heroism.</p>
				<p>Be Jerma. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.</p>
				<p>Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with Jerma.</p>
				<p>You are a Jermas of the universe, no less than the trees and the sters; you have a right to be Jerma. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt Jerma is unfolding as it should.</p>
				<p>Therefore be at peace with Jerma, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your Jerma.</p>
				<p>With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful Jerma. Be cheerful. Strive to be Jerma.</p>
